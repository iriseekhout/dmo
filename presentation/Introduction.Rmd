## Suggested literature

* Website about missing data: www.missingdata.nl
* Flexible Imputation of Missing Data (Stef van Buuren): https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/

## Most important `R` packages

For missing data handling:

* `mice`: multiple imputation by chained equations
* `miceadds`: additional Multiple Imputation Functions, Especially for 'mice'

Other R packages

* `dplyr`: for data manipulation, summarizing and grouping
* `tidyr`: tools for shaping and structuring data.
